#Download the data
#Here we are going to use some data from the paper Detection of redundant fusion transcripts as biomarkers or disease-specific therapeutic targets in breast cancer. that uses data from different normal human tissues (called the Illumina BodyMap data).

#Fit a simple linear regression
#Here we regress the counts for the first gene on the age of the people from whom the tissue was drawn.

edata = as.matrix(edata)

#Is fitting the line a good idea?
#Visual diagnostics are often some of the most helpful

#What about categorical variables?

#Visualize the difference between genders

#Interactions (careful!)
#You can add interaction terms, but there are a couple of things to keep in mind:
  #Interpretation can be challenging
  #You should always also include main effects
  #Interactions in genomics data are in general hard to detect, and can be fraught for example in gene by environment interactions, the interaction term only tells you that there may be an association, but there are lots of reasons for this statistical association that aren’t biological interaction.

lm4 = lm(edata[1,] ~ pdata$age*pdata$gender)

#A few things to be aware of
#Outliers can have a big impact on the regression, depending on where they land. Here there isn’t much impact

#In general you’d like your residuals to looks symmetrically (e.g. approximately Normally) distributed but they aren’t here. Outliers in the residuals aren’t great either.

#Data transforms are often applied before regression and the residuals look a little better here.

lm7 = lm(gene1 ~ index)
hist(lm7$residuals,col=4)

#Be careful when two variables in your regression model are very highly correlated. This is called co-linearity and can lead to highly variable and uninterpretable results. R fails “gracefully” (i.e. doesn’t tell you) when this happens so you have to check by hand. This is also a problem if you fit too many variables for example.

lm8 = lm(gene1 ~ pdata$tissue.type + pdata$age)

#Another good idea is to look for “patterns” in the residuals
