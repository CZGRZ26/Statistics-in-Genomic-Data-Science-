# Statistics-in-Genomic-Data-Science-
Cheat sheets for different statistic techniques used in genomic data science.
This course is structured to hit the key conceptual ideas of normalization, exploratory analysis, linear modeling, testing, and multiple testing that arise over and over in genomic studies.

This repository documents my applied learning in statistical methods for genomic data science. It brings together concepts, worked examples, and code implementations that are foundational to the analysis of high-dimensional biological data such as gene expression and genomic variation.

Topics Covered:

1) Exploratory Data Analysis

  Visualizing genomic datasets and distributions

  Identifying variability and structure in data

2) Data Transforms & Normalization

  Quantile normalization

  Common transformations used in genomics (log, variance-stabilizing, etc.)

3) Statistical Testing

  Rapid calculation of t-tests and F-tests

  P-values and multiple testing correction (Bonferroni, Benjaminiâ€“Hochberg)

4) Regression & Generalized Linear Models

  Linear regression

  Many regressions across genomic features

  GLMs for count and categorical outcomes

5) Dimensionality Reduction & Clustering

  PCA and other approaches to reduce dimensionality in genomics

  Clustering methods to detect sample or gene groups

6) Batch Effects & Confounders

  Identifying and correcting for technical or biological confounders

  Understanding their impact on inference

7) Gene Sets & Pathway Analysis

  Working with predefined gene sets

  Linking statistical signals to biological pathways

8) The Three Tables in Genomics

  Conceptual framework for integrating genomic data

  Understanding subject-level, feature-level, and result-level tables

9) Expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTL) Analysis

  Linking genetic variants to gene expression changes

  Introductory eQTL frameworks
